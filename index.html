            <p>This is my Project Gallery, given as an assignment by my instructor at <strong><abbr title="Saylani Mass IT Training">S.M.I.T</abbr></strong> institute!
                I plan on adding all my future projects here too, but for now, I have added my previous HTML assignments
                here and submitted them on Google Classroom.
                <br>The <b>First Assignment</b> is a simple <b>Curriculum Vitae</b> I created after learning the basics
                of HTML.
                <br>The <b>Second Assignment</b> I completed was <b>The Periodic Table</b>, which our instructor
                assigned to help us understand the behavior of the Table tag.
                <br>The <b>Third Assignment</b> is a <b>Student Registration Form</b>. The instructor assigned it after
                teaching the form tag, making it the last assignment before this one.
